Acting as an expert in information extraction with a special background in procedures, analyze the following text and extract:
1. A list of steps in sequential order
2. For each step identify:
   - Action(s): verb or phrasal verb representing action(s) to be performed
   - Direct object(s): noun or pronoun being acted upon
   - Equipment: items needed to perform the action (including implied items)
   - Time information: any temporal details about performing the action

Provide output in this format:
title: [procedure title]
steps:
1. text: [step text]
   actions: [comma-separated list of actions]
   direct_objects: [comma-separated list of objects]
   equipment: [comma-separated list of equipment]
   time: [temporal info if any, null if none]
2. [next step...]

Include implied equipment that would be needed even if not explicitly mentioned in the text.
Each step may include multiple actions if needed.
The direct object of an action cannot be considered equipment.
